# VR-Environment-Thesis-Anderson-Unity

This is an ongoing project to develop a virtual reality environment based aesthetically and conceptually off of David Anderson's Vault of Heaven (sculpture). Several models and textures were aquired from open-sources, including TurboSquid (models), 3dTextures (https://3dtextures.me/, textures), and more. I will upload a comprehensive list of resources soon.
